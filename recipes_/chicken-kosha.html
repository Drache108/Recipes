    <img src="../images/chickenKosha.jpg" alt="Ckicken Kosha">
    <p>Chicken Kosha, a classic Bengali delicacy, is a spicy, rich, slow-cooked chicken dish characterized by its deep color and thick, aromatic gravy.
     The &ldquo;kosha&rdquo; method refers to the process of &ldquo;bhuna,&rdquo; or slow frying the ingredients in their own juices and oil to release maximum flavor.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Here is a recipe for this flavorful dish.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mustard oil</li>

        <li>5-6 cloves</li>
        <li>2 dry red chilies</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>3-4 green chilies, slit (optional, for extra heat)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ghee (clarified butter), for finishing</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with all the marinade ingredients. Mix everything thoroughly to coat the chicken evenly. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (preferably longer, up to 3-4 hours in the refrigerator for deeper flavor).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Spices and Oil:</strong> Heat the mustard oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over medium heat until it reaches its smoking point. Once it cools slightly, add the whole spices: bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamoms, cloves, and dry red chilies. Sauté for a few seconds until they splutter and release their aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Onions:</strong> Add the thinly sliced onions and a pinch of salt to speed up the browning process. Fry the onions until they turn golden brown and are well caramelized.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Masalas and Tomatoes:</strong> Stir in the remaining ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears. Add the tomato paste/chopped tomatoes, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Cook the masala mixture on a low-medium flame, stirring continuously, until the oil starts to separate from the edges of the masala (about 5-10 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken (Kosha):</strong> Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan. Mix well with the spices. Cover the pan and cook on a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally, for about 20-25 minutes. The chicken will cook in its own juices and the caramelized onion mixture, developing the rich "kosha" flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer and Finish:</strong> If the mixture becomes too dry, add a splash of warm water (around 1 cup in total, in small increments if needed). Cover and simmer the chicken until it is completely tender and the gravy has thickened to a semi-dry, coating consistency. Adjust for salt if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Just before serving, sprinkle the garam masala powder and drizzle the ghee over the chicken. Add the slit green chilies (if using) and fresh coriander leaves, stir well, and remove from the heat.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Chicken Kosha is best served hot with luchi (Bengali fried flatbread), parathas, or steamed basmati rice. </p>
