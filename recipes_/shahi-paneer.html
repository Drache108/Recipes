    <p>To make a rich and creamy Shahi Paneer, you'll need approximately 40-50 minutes. The gravy is a flavorful blend of onions, tomatoes, and cashews, finished with cream and spices. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paneer:</strong> 250g, cubed</li>
        <li><strong>Onions:</strong> 1 medium, roughly chopped</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> 2 medium, roughly chopped</li>
        <li><strong>Cashews:</strong> 20-22 raw</li>
        <li><strong>Ghee or Butter:</strong> 3 tbsp (divided)</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Spices:</strong> 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1 bay leaf, 1 inch cinnamon, 2-3 cloves, 3-4 black peppercorns, 2 green cardamom</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger-Garlic Paste:</strong> 1 tbsp</li>
        <li><strong>Powdered Spices:</strong> 1 tsp red chili powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp coriander powder, 1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li><strong>Liquids:</strong> 1/2 cup water (for cooking base), 1/4 cup whole milk cream</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning & Garnish:</strong> 1 tsp salt (to taste), 1/2 tsp honey or sugar, 1 tsp kasuri methi (crushed fenugreek leaves), 1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, for garnish </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Base Gravy</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of ghee and a little oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the whole spices (cumin seeds, bay leaf, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and black peppercorns) and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and chopped onion. Stir well and cook for 3-4 minutes until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and raw cashews. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add 1/2 cup of water and salt. Continue cooking for about 8-10 minutes until the tomatoes and cashews have softened.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaf and cinnamon stick (if desired, to avoid a strong flavor when blending) and allow the mixture to cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooled mixture to a blender and blend into a smooth puree. Strain the puree through a sieve to achieve a silky smooth, restaurant-style gravy texture. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assemble the Shahi Paneer</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the same pan, heat the remaining ghee (or butter). Once hot, add the red chili powder, turmeric powder, and coriander powder. Cook for only a few seconds, being careful not to burn the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour the strained base gravy into the pan. Mix well and reduce the flame to medium-low. Add hot water at this stage if you prefer a thinner consistency. Simmer for 7-8 minutes until the gravy thickens.</li>
        <li>Soak the cubed paneer in warm water for a few minutes to soften, then drain and add the cubes to the gravy.</li>
        <li>Add the honey (or sugar), garam masala, kasuri methi (crushed between your palms), and half of the fresh cream.</li>
        <li>Stir gently to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes. Adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Turn off the flame. Garnish with the remaining fresh cream and chopped fresh coriander leaves.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Serve hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice.</p>
